# 🛣️ Pothole Detection using YOLOv8 Segmentation

This project implements an AI-based solution for automatic pothole detection and segmentation using the **YOLOv8-nano segmentation model**. Developed during an internship at **IIT Guwahati, Signal Processing Lab**, the model is designed for real-time performance and practical deployment in road safety and infrastructure maintenance systems.

## 📌 Objective

- Accurately detect and segment potholes in diverse road environments.
- Deliver real-time inference speeds suitable for video stream processing.
- Develop a scalable, cost-effective pipeline for smart infrastructure monitoring.

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- Auto-orientation and resizing to 640×640
- Augmentation: flipping, cropping, rotation, brightness & exposure adjustment
- YAML config for seamless training pipeline integration

### 2. Model Training
- Pretrained YOLOv8n-seg.pt weights
- 150 epochs, batch size 16
- Dropout: 0.25 | Learning rate: 0.0001 → 0.01
- Early stopping with patience=15

### 3. Inference Pipeline
- Frame-wise video processing using OpenCV
- Outputs annotated MP4s with pothole masks
- Real-time speed: ~10.9 ms/frame (~90 fps)
